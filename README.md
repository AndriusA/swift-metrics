## Providing Feedback

Feedback that would really be great is:
- if anything, what does this proposal *not cover* that you will definitely need
- if anything, what could we remove from this and still be happy?
- API-wise: what do you like, what don't you like?

Feel free to post this as message on the SSWG forum and/or github issues in this repo.
